Movie Recommendation System.

The recommendation is based on content based, popularity based and collaborative filtering.
We are trying to build an ensemble of these models to come up with our final recommendation system. 
For this we have two MovieLens datasets.
Simple Recommendation System is based on Popularity and ratings of the movie.
Personalised Recommendation system is based on Similar movies sorted on the basis of expected ratings by that particular user.
